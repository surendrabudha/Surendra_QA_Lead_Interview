# Activity Ranking API - City-Based Weather Forecast Integration: QA Test Deliverables

This repository contains the deliverables for the Activity Ranking API feature test, as outlined in the provided QA Lead Test document. My approach focuses on clarity, comprehensive coverage, and realistic testing strategies, encompassing manual testing, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Gherkin, and automated end-to-end tests.

### Overview of My Approach

As a Senior Software Quality Assurance Engineer, I've designed these tests to ensure the "Activity Ranking API - City-Based Weather Forecast Integration with Search Suggestions" feature meets its functional and non-functional requirements. My strategy involved:

1.  **Deep Feature Understanding**: Thoroughly analyzing the user stories and acceptance criteria provided in the feature ticket to grasp the core functionality and user expectations.
2.  **Manual Test Script Development**: Crafting a detailed, step-by-step manual test script to guide manual testers through critical paths, including happy flows and various edge cases. This script serves as a baseline for exploratory testing and provides clear expected results.
3.  **BDD Scenario Definition (Gherkin)**: Translating key user behaviors and system expectations into Gherkin-style scenarios. This ensures that the tests are human-readable, promote collaboration between stakeholders, and serve as living documentation. I've covered a happy path, an edge case for autocomplete, and an error handling scenario.
4.  **Automated Test Implementation**: Developing robust automated tests using TypeScript, Cucumber.js, and Playwright. This combination provides an effective framework for end-to-end UI testing and allows for the simulation of complex user interactions and network conditions.
5.  **Focus on Maintainability**: Writing clean, readable, and modular code for automation with appropriate comments, ensuring the test suite is easy to understand, debug, and extend in the future.

## How AI Assisted Me

In preparing these deliverables, I leveraged AI tools, specifically large language models, primarily for:

* **Syntax and Structure Refinement**: Generating boilerplate code for Cucumber step definitions and Playwright interactions, which I then tailored and expanded upon with my specific logic and assertions. This accelerated the initial setup phase.
* **Conceptual Brainstorming**: Prompting for additional edge case ideas beyond the explicitly mentioned ones to ensure broader test coverage (though I focused on the specified ones for this exercise's scope).
* **Documentation Formatting**: Assisting with the initial markdown formatting for `README.md` and the manual test script, ensuring a professional and consistent presentation.

My judgment was critical in applying the AI output. I meticulously reviewed all generated content for accuracy, relevance to the feature ticket, adherence to best practices, and alignment with the specific requirements of the task. I ensured that the code was logical, efficient, and integrated seamlessly with the chosen testing frameworks. The core test logic, assertions, and BDD scenario design were my primary contributions, with AI serving as a productivity enhancer.

## Omissions & Trade-offs

Given the time expectation of 2-3 hours and the focus on clarity and structure over completeness[cite: 50], I made the following conscious omissions and trade-offs:

* **Comprehensive Test Data Management**: For automated tests, I've used hardcoded values. In a real-world scenario, I would implement a more sophisticated test data management strategy (e.g., using fixtures, factories, or external data sources) to handle various test cases and data permutations more effectively.
* **Extensive UI Interaction Coverage**: While Playwright is used, the UI interactions are kept to the necessary minimum to trigger the core functionality (typing, selecting suggestions). A full-fledged UI test suite would involve more visual assertions, accessibility checks, and responsiveness testing.
* **Detailed API Mocking for All Scenarios**: For the API failure scenario, I've demonstrated basic Playwright network mocking. In a more complex setup, I would use a dedicated API mocking library (e.g., MSW, WireMock) to create more elaborate and persistent mock responses for various API states and error codes, allowing for isolated testing of API integration logic.
* **Performance and Security Testing**: These aspects are critical but fall outside the scope of this particular feature test. A complete QA strategy would include separate performance testing (load, stress) and security testing (vulnerability scanning, penetration testing).
* **Cross-Browser Testing**: The automated tests are set up with Chromium. For a production-grade application, cross-browser compatibility would be verified using Playwright's capabilities across Firefox, WebKit, and potentially other browsers.
* **CI/CD Integration**: The provided code is for local execution. In a professional setting, these tests would be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to run automatically on every code commit.

Despite these omissions, the provided deliverables aim to thoroughly cover the core requirements of the feature ticket and demonstrate a robust understanding of modern QA practices.
